Allows you to create a global discussion prefix (ex: [Solved]) that can be applied 
to discussions via a custom-labelled checkbox on the new/edit discussion form.

Creates new permissions for managing and using prefixes that must be enabled in
the dashboard before users will be able to use it.

**Requires Vanilla 2.0.14 (yup, not released yet).

To make compatible with 2.0.13, edit applications/vanilla/views/post/discussion.php

Find this near line 41:

      if ($Options != '')
         echo '<ul class="PostOptions">' . $Options .'</ul>';

And ADD this BEFORE it:

      $this->EventArguments['Options'] = &$Options;
      $this->FireEvent('DiscussionFormOptions');
